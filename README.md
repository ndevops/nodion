# Nodion â€“ Simple Cloud Hosting
We are currently working on a free cloud hosting control panel similar to the panels you are used to from using DigitalOcean, Vultr or Linode. We want to replace our current solution at https://www.nodion.com, which is why we are building it from the ground up. While everything around the project will be released open source we are also working on a hosted version as well as offering business and enterprise support.
